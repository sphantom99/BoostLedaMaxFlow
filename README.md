# BoostLedaMaxFlow

This project was assigned to me in the subject "Application Technologies for Algorithms". Essentially it is an implementation of an algorithm to detect the max flow of a bipartite graph. It is implemented in a renowned C++ library called BOOST and it is compared with the standard implementation of the LEDA library.

## How to run
 To run this project you require both LEDA and BOOST libraries in your system. Afterwards you can alter the make file to right command and use the make command to run the main script.
